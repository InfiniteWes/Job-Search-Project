# Job-Search-Project

### Project for Object Oriented Programming:

```
This Project was built in basic Java.
We were given the following task:
  Job Search Platform:
      o Description: Develop a platform for job seekers to search for employment
        opportunities, submit applications, and track their job search progress.
      Example:
        o Encapsulate the applicant's information, such as their resume and contact details,
          within a class representing a job application. Inheritance can be employed to
          establish hierarchies among entities; for instance, FullTimeJob and PartTimeJob
          classes can inherit from a generic Job class.
        o Raise an exception "JobApplicationException" when a user attempts to submit an
          incomplete application form, prompting them to fill in all required fields before
          proceeding.

```

### Use:
Running through the Program in a terminal, it will ask you if you are looking for a job.
This will display various jobs for the user to select from, where this will be prompted
to enter the file path to their resume. Upon doing so, it will display ther resume contents.
After this, the user can then enter more information to submit an application for the Job.
