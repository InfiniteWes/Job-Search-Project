# Job-Search-Project

### Project for Object Oriented Programming:

```
This Project was built in basic Java.
We were given the following task:
  Job Search Platform:
      o Description: Develop a platform for job seekers to search for employment
        opportunities, submit applications, and track their job search progress.
      Example:
        o Encapsulate the applicant's information, such as their resume and contact details,
          within a class representing a job application. Inheritance can be employed to
          establish hierarchies among entities; for instance, FullTimeJob and PartTimeJob
          classes can inherit from a generic Job class.
        o Raise an exception "JobApplicationException" when a user attempts to submit an
          incomplete application form, prompting them to fill in all required fields before
          proceeding.

```
